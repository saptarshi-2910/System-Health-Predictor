### Smart Health Prediction System: Enhancing Medical Performance through Data Analysis

Predicting an individual’s health performance has become increasingly challenging. Many people only discover serious health issues due to inadequate medical assessments. With the massive amounts of health data recorded daily, medical centers have the potential to analyze this information to identify patterns, reasons, and solutions, thereby preventing severe consequences in the future.

The primary goal of our project is to develop an application leveraging database management concepts, utilizing IntelliJ IDEA (Java), and SQL. This application aims to predict diseases based on patient-input symptoms, transforming raw data into valuable information and knowledge—a process known as "knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)." The raw data for this project is sourced from the web and carefully selected for further processing. This data is then entered into a database using SQL.

The current method for doctors to diagnose a patient’s illness can be lengthy and arduous. A smart health prediction system, designed to assist healthcare professionals in their decision-making process, aims to streamline this process. By significantly reducing the time required to identify disease patterns and determining optimal solutions, this system enhances efficiency. For effective operation, it relies on substantial quantities of data to predict a patient’s health accurately.

With this system, healthcare providers can improve the accuracy and speed of their diagnoses, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
